Class III Decision Support System (Fuzzy–AI Model)
Orthodontic Treatment Decision Aid for Skeletal Class III Patients

This repository provides a clinical decision-support tool that integrates a fuzzy membership model (MG-Sk3) and a decision-tree–based algorithm to help classify orthodontic patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion into Camouflage or Surgery treatment pathways.

The model combines cephalometric skeletal measurements and a soft-tissue–based fuzzy estimate of Class III severity (MG-Sk3).
A MATLAB App version is packaged for end-users without requiring code execution.

Features

Fuzzy MG-Sk3 estimation based on soft-tissue profile appearance
LC-based fuzzy computation from ANB, Gn–Nperp, SN, Go–Me
Decision tree for treatment selection
Clean clinical explanation automatically generated
Optional ChatGPT-based summarization
Executable Runtime option for non-MATLAB users (optional)
